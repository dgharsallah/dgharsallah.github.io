<p>I am an Artificial Intelligence engineer with a background in Software Engineering.
    I've always loved to create products and solve problems that will make our life easier and the world better which is
    the main reason that I'm an engineer.
    I've worked on various software engineering projects including web, mobile and desktop apps.
    Now, since I am a big fan of algorithms and problem solving I've switched to work on solving real-life NP-hard
    problems using algorithms, optimization & AI techniques. </p>
